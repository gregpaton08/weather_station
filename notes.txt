    http://api.wunderground.com/api/<API KEY>/forecast/q/NJ/Collingswood.json

Current Task:
* Generate new API key
* Cache the weather results with a timestamp to limit number of API calls
	* Display the time it was last updated
	* Add an option to force refresh?

To do:
* write POC pyton script to get temperate from thermometer
* store on github (hide API key!)
* Set up subdomain of gregpaton08.com to point to RPi (use A Record and noip.com)
* Design the interface
	* House graphic containing indoor temp
	* Sun (or clouds or current weather) alongside outdoor temp
* List out the days (hour by hour) forecast
* List out the week (day by day) forecast


Done:
* Setup Flask server for app
* parse JSON for temperature data
* hook up thermometer to RPi
