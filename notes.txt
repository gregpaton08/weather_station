Example:
	http://api.wunderground.com/api/<API KEY>/conditions/q/NJ/Collingswood.json
    http://api.wunderground.com/api/<API KEY>/forecast/q/NJ/Collingswood.json
    # for sunrise/sunset
    http://api.wunderground.com/api/<API KEY>/astronomy/q/NJ/Collingswood.json

Current Task:
* Cache the weather results with a timestamp to limit number of API calls
	* Display the time it was last updated
	* Add an option to force refresh? <-- NO

To do:
* Set up subdomain of gregpaton08.com to point to RPi (use A Record and noip.com)
* Design the interface
	* House graphic containing indoor temp
    * Design graphics in Sketch
	* Sun (or clouds or current weather) alongside outdoor temp
* List out the days (hour by hour) forecast
* List out the week (day by day) forecast
* Add historical data (data base to store inside temp?)
    * Run background process on RPi (chron) to update database with indoor temperature every 10 minutes
    * Access database in flask app http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/tutorial/schema/
* Graph inside temp
* Graph forecast for outside
* Consolidate AJAX data request into a single request (instead of separate requests for indoor/outdoor temperature)
* Update C/F link in callback so that it is in sync with the data displayed


Done:
* Setup Flask server for app
* parse JSON for temperature data
* hook up thermometer to RPi
* write POC pyton script to get temperature from thermometer
* store on github (hide API key!)
* Generate new API key
* Add option to choose celsius or fahrenheit
* Compute C to F conversion in javascript to avoid network access to the server
